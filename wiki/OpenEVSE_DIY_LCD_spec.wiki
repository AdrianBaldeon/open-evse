OpenEVSE LCD Boards are designed specifically for OpenEVSE Charging Stations. They are very compact and easy to interface with 4 wires 5v, GND, i2c SCL i2c SDA. The OpenEVSE LCD boards support Monochrome (single color) or RGB LCDs (Red - Green - Blue color mixing) and are available with or without a RTC (Real Time Clock)to add EVSE Based timer based functionality. <b><font color=red>Note </font></b> - Vehicle based timers will work with or without RTC.

The OpenEVSE RGB LCD uses the [https://github.com/lincomatic/LiquidTWI2 LiquidTWI2] library written by OpenEVSE firmware guru Lincomatic. 

The optional RTC utilizes the DS1307 chip. A CR1220 or CR1225 lithium battery is required but not included due to shipping restrictions.

== Schematic, Board files, Gerber files =
It is a good idea to print the schematic for reference.
