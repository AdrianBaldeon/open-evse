Basics of the J1772 standard.

= Charging =

|| || Voltage || Max Current || 
|| Level 1 (L1) || 120VAC || 16A max per J1772||
|| Level 2 (L2) || 208 - 240VAC || 80A ||

= Pilot =
The J1772 Pilot is a 1khz +12V to -12V square wave, the voltage defines the state and the duty cycle defines the current available to the EV. The EVSE sets the duty cycle and the EV adds resistance from the pilot the Ground to vary the voltage. The EVSE reads the voltage and changes state accordingly. 

|| State || Pilot Voltage High || Pilot Voltage Low || EV Resistance || Description || PWM ||
|| State A || +12v || N/A || N/A || Not Connected || DC ||
|| State B || +9v || -12v || 2.74k || Connected || 1000 Hz ||
|| State C || +6v || -12v || 882 || Charging || 1000 Hz ||
|| State D || +3v || -12v || 246 || Ventilation Required || 1000 Hz ||
|| State E || 0 || 0 || N/A || No power || N/A ||
|| State F || N/A || -12v || N/A || EVSE Error || DC ||

= Max Current =
Up to 51A

Amps = Duty cycle x 0.6

Duty cycle = Amps / 0.6


51 - 80A

Amps = (Duty Cycle - 64) * 2.5

Duty cycle = (Amps / 2.5) + 64

=Proximity=
The proximity runs between the EV and the J1772 handle, some J1772 cordsets include 4 wires (AC Hot 1, AC Hot 2, Ground, Pilot) and some have 5 wires an additional to access the proximity circuit. 

The proximity circuit should read about 450-500 ohms when measured from proximity to ground. When the button is pressed the reading should drop to about 150 ohms. The change in resistance signals the EV to stop pulling current. The relay in the EVSE will stay closed until the pilot is dropped however J1772 compliant EVs will stop pulling significant current.

*Note*- There have been many reports of missing proximity components or binding in the switch of inexpensive J1772 cables from China. Before using on of these cables measure resistance in the proximity circuit and ensure the resistance drops as expected when the button is pressed.
