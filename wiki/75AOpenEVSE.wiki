#summary A 75A EVSE built with an Open EVSE board.

= Introduction =

This is an example of a 75A EVSE built with the Open EVSE V4.0 DIY PCB (originally built with OpenEVSE Arduino Shield & Arduino). 

This should not be attempted by anyone without the required skills and knowledge to work with high voltage.

Open EVSE is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

= EVSE Ground =

NOTE: The Open EVSE control Board must be grounded to the EV/Earth Ground for the pilot to operate correctly. 

= Circuit =

Note: for full 75A Operation, wire this with #3 AWG Copper wire for the (2) hots (I used Red and Black), and a #6 THHN for Ground (I used Green) to a 100A circuit breaker, a good low cost source for #3 THHN is "StayOnline", see this link:
