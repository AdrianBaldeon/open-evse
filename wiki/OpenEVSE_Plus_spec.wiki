The OpenEVSE Plus J1772 controller board kit comes with all the surface mount parts assembled, firmware loaded and includes the components to finish the controller board. The builder must solder the remaining through hole components.

=Building the Kit=

All through hole parts are placed on the opposite side as the surface mount components, but soldered on the same side as the surface mounts. The board has markings to identify the parts and correct placement.

Take care not to touch existing components with the soldering iron. Position board so soldering can occur without interference with other parts.

Start with the smallest components and work up to the larger ones so that when you flip the board over the parts will not fall out.

First solder the 2 Flame proof resistors (22k for 120v/240v and 47k for 230v)

Next solder the 2 MID400 chips, check markings on chip and board for proper polarity.
