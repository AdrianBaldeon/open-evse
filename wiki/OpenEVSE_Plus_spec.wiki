The OpenEVSE Plus J1772 controller board kits come with all the surface mount parts assembled and firmware loaded. The through hole components are included, but not soldered. That work is left for the builder.

=Building the Kit=

All through hole parts are placed on the opposite side from the surface mount components, but soldered on the same side as the surface mounts. The board has markings to identify the parts and correct placement.

Take care not to touch existing components with the soldering iron. Position board so soldering can occur without interference with other parts.

Start with the smallest components and work up to the larger ones so that when you flip the board over the parts will not fall out.

First solder the 2 Flame proof resistors (22k for 120v/240v split-phase American systems and 47k for 230v European systems)

Next solder the 2 MID400 chips, check markings on chip and board for proper polarity.

Next solder the 2 Bel fuses, 2 small 2 pin screw terminals and the 3 pin screw terminal.
