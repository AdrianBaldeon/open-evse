=Building the Kit=

All through hole parts are placed on the opposite side from the surface mount components, but soldered on the same side as the surface mounts. The board has markings to identify the parts and correct placement.

Take care not to touch existing components with the soldering iron. Position board so soldering can occur without interference with other parts.

Start with the smallest components and work up to the larger ones so that when you flip the board over the parts will not fall out.

First solder the 2 Flame proof resistors (47k for 120v/240v split-phase American and 230v European systems)

Next solder the 2 Bel fuses.

Next solder the DC/DC converter and the .1" pin headers.

Solder the large 2 pin Screw Terminal.
