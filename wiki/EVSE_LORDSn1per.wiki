= Introduction =
The Following photos illustrate installation of an Arduino UNO, Arduino Shield, an Adafruit RGB LCD open EVSE.

My primary goal was to build an EVSE for under $1000. Living here in Australia a simple EVSE was $4999 and a CHEAP one was $1899! In Australia our electricity is 240v in either 10A or 15A. The supplied EVSE for my Nissan Leaf was 240v 10A but I'd like to have a permanent EVSE on the wall in my garage that can supply 15A.

I plan that my EVSE will be of high commercial standards,offering good weather protection ,and incorporating latest firmware. The adafruit RGB display was utililised as well as 2 buttons, MENU and RESET 

This is still a work in progress so come back often for updates

Finished assembling the RGB LCD screen from Adafruit. http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8049/8140962969_f8fce06df9_c.jpg


My first Arduino program to test LCD.

Modified v1.0.0 to add my name and KW power display next to timer. http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8473/8140962169_ea7fe36a84_c.jpg

v1.0.3 now displays cost instead of KW.

Finished building the Open EVSE Arduino Shield. Note I have put R1 in R20. That will be removed and R20 and R1's position by accident. I have now replaced both of them with blue metal film 1Kohm 1% resistors.

Booting up v1.0.3 of my customised evse
Includes my name with animation
Includes the price being drawn next to timer. The cents per kwh has to be manually programmed in but I'm working on creating a new menu so you can change it using the button and LCD screen.
