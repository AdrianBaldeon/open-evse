#summary OpenEVSE using Diversified Stage OpenEVSE Enclosure and OpenEVSE Plus v2 with LCD and RTC.

= Introduction =
I bought a Ford C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid in March. It came with 110v charge cable which worked well for overnight charging, but I wanted the ability to get my range back during quick stops at home during the day. That meant a 240v EVSE. I decided on the OpenEVSE because it was relatively inexpensive and because I enjoy building things. That said, I'm not very confident in my soldering skills so I opted for a fully-built OpenEVSE board with the Real Time Clock (RTC) and LCD display. Most of the builds on this wiki use Nema boxes. I decided to get the Diversified Stage custom box because I liked the look of it and they had already done all the hard work.

= Collect the parts =

The first step was gathering all the materials. A Leviton 30-amp charge cable is on the left. Next to it is a 10-gauge rubber cable from Home Depot that I had left over from a home generator project. Inside that coil are 2 gland nuts, 2 fuse holders and a 30-amp relay. Upper right is a 30-amp twist lock plug and an illuminated button from Adafruit.

On the left is a ground bus bar sold for home circuit breaker panels. The two circuit boards on the silver envelopes are what you get when you buy an OpenEVSE "kit". The top one is the smarts of the system. Below it is an optional LCD display. To the right are crimp terminals and some "cheaters" for the relay. The grey panel underneath comes with the Diversified Stage box and is where you mount all the components.

A lot of people install their EVSE inside a standard NEMA box. I decided to try out this new ready-built case from Diversified Stage. It's a bit large but it's very heavy duty and all the holes are already cut.

I ordered the box at the same time I ordered all the other parts. After I got it and was examining the backing plate I realized I didn't know what the predrilled holes were for. An email to DS and they sent me the link to a schematic: http://client.diversifiedstage.com/file/evse_indoor_assembly_drawing.pdf (I don't know why they don't put this inside the box when you buy it). It specifies specific relay, fuse holder and grounding bar. I lucked out with the relay I bought, but my fuse holders and ground bar are different. Fortunately it was easy to adapt the plate to what I bought but you may want to go right for the "correct" ones when you're ordering parts.

= Assembly =

Here are the parts mounted on the backing plate. DS included screws and washers for mounting the EVSE and the LCD display but I had to scrounge the rest. You'll need washers for the bolts holding the relay in place.

The OpenEVSE board mounted on its standoffs. There are fiber washers under the screw heads. The lower right one hit the headers so I had to sand a couple flats on it.

The LCD display and illuminated button mounted. This pic shows off my lousy soldering. I should have put heat shrink on there too. I did protect this before final assembly. I had to enlarge the hole slightly for this particular button. I got the Real-Time Clock (RTC) option so there's a battery that will go in that silver clip to keep the clock running.
