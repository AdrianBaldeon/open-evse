#summary Add Wifi to OpenEVSE.

This solution does not require any additional code on the OpenEVSE side. Here is how I did it...

=WIFI Module Configuration= 

There are several ways to program the module to connect to your network. The easiest is with a 3.3v FTDI cable with a terminal set to 9600 enter $$$ at the prompt and use this guide for ssid, ip, change uart to 38400 for OpenEVSE, etc.

An alternate is to setup a ad-hoc network with SSID roving1, the module will join. the tricky part is discovering the modules ip address. With the IP address telnet to the IPaddress:2000 and type $$$

=Connect to OpenEVSE via WIFI=
 
Once configured you can access OpenEVSE SerialCLI using a telnet app (I like PuTTY) via the IPaddress:2000 (example 192.168.1.123:2000).

 
The Module also has a HTTP client so it will not be too hard to send data to a webserver in the future...
