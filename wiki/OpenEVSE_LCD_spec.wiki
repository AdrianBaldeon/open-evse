LCD Boards are now avaliable designed specificly for OpenEVSE. They were designed to be very compact and easy to interface. The OpenEVSE LCD boards support RGB LCDs and are avaliable with or without a RTC(Real Time Clock) to add timer based functionality. 

The OpenEVSE RGB LCD is based on and compatible with the Adafruit RGB LCD Arduino shield and for OpenEVSE uses the LiquitTWI2 library by lincomatic. 

The optional RTC is based on the DS3231 ultra-precice temperature compensated RTC. 

The .1 inch header pins are soldered to each board in order to connect them to the i2c pins on the OpenEVSE board.

When soldering, be sure to have the included plastic spacers in place to establish the proper spacing. 

The ribbon cable goes from the 4-wire header to the i2c header on the Open EVSE board. Be sure to pay attention to which side is ground on both ends. The ground pin has a square copper solder pad around it for easy identification.

There are 5 holes labeled S-R-D-U-L. These are for the control button.

S - Select - Supported by OpenEVSE button Menu

R - Right - Not currently used

D - Down - Not currently used

U - Up - Not currently used

L - Left - Not currently used
 

To enable the button on the LCD solder a wire (not included in kit) to the S - Select hole and another wire to any of the ground holes. Connect to a normaly Open momentary button. A lit button can be connected using Ground, +5v and Select.

== Assemble the RGB LCD and shield ==

The LCD comes as a small kit containing a shield board, the LCD board, a pin header, 4 plastic spacers, and a jumper wire. The following photos show how to assemble them.

Notice that the angled 4-pin header points away from the surface mount component. If you do it the other way, it will interfere. 
*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Remember the little component labelled "VR-1" in the lower left corner of this picture. You will need to turn that with a tiny screwdriver after the project is complete to set the display brightness the first time you power up your EVSE.

Solder the .1" header pins to the controller board.  
Once the headers are soldered to the shield board, place the LCD board over the header row as shown below. Be sure to place the 4 plastic spacers at each corner prior to soldering the pins!

To add a control button, you need to solder .1" header pins or wires into the shield board. Connect one to any of the 5 ground pads and the other to the "S" pad. If using a lit button solder to GND, +5v and "S"
