OpenEVSE i2c LCD Boards are now available designed specifically for OpenEVSE Charging Stations. They are very compact and easy to interface. The OpenEVSE LCD boards support RGB LCDs and are available with or without a RTC(Real Time Clock)to add EVSE Based timer based functionality. Vehicle based timers work with or without RTC.

The OpenEVSE RGB LCD uses the [https://github.com/lincomatic/LiquidTWI2 LiquitTWI2] library written by OpenEVSE firmware guru Lincomatic. 

The optional RTC utilizes the DS3231 ultra-precice temperature compensated RTC. A CR1220 or CR1225 lithium battery is required but not included due to shipping restrictions.

Optional - Solder a 3 pin header on the S - Row for use with a button switch.

If using right angled header pins ensure the pins are pointed down.
