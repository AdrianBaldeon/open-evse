OpenEVSE i2c LCD Boards are now available designed specifically for OpenEVSE Charging Stations. They are very compact and easy to interface. The OpenEVSE LCD boards support RGB LCDs and are available with or without a RTC(Real Time Clock)to add EVSE Based timer based functionality. Vehicle based timers work with or without RTC.

The OpenEVSE RGB LCD uses the [https://github.com/lincomatic/LiquidTWI2 LiquitTWI2] library written by OpenEVSE firmware guru Lincomatic. 

The optional RTC utilizes the DS3231 ultra-precice temperature compensated RTC. A CR1220 or CR1225 is required but not included due to shipping retrictions.

= Assembly =

First start with the OpenEVSE LCD logic board. Solder the .1" 4-pin header to the i2c connector (If your board has two use the connector on the left).

Optional - Solder a 3 pin header on the S - Row for use with a button switch.

If using right angled header pins ensure the pins are pointed down.

Solder the 18 pin .1" header to the OpenEVSE logic board.  

Once the headers are soldered to the logic board, place the LCD board on top of the LCD module. Be sure to place the 4 plastic spacers at each corner prior to soldering the pins to ensure proper spacing.

Finally - Power up your board connected to an OpenEVSE J1772 Controller and adjust the contrast with a small screw driver until the lettering is bright but the background is still dark.
