*If you just have to be different than the cool kids who use Arduino IDE, you can use Atmel Studio to load your firmware*

== Download and install Atmel Studio ==
[http://Atmel Studio] is a free development environment for the MS Windows environment. It is built on Visual Studio using .NET framework. So far, nobody has found a way to run it on Linux using wine due to the .NET requirement. If you find a way, you will be a superhero. Or possibly really need to get out of your mothers basement... 


== Set Fuse Bits ==
Setting fuse bits only needs to be done once. Fuse bits have nothing to do with power overload protection; they are the software equivalent of dip switches (if you are old enough to remember those...) and control how the chip operates. The officially supported fuse bit settings for OpenEVSE will be the best settings for most people, but if you want to experiment with different settings, you can calculate fuse settings here: http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc

To set fuse bits from Atmel Studio, select "Tools -> Device Programming". Select your programmer from the _Tool_ drop down, select "ATmega328" from the _Device_ drop down, and select "ISP" from the Interface drop down. Click the Apply button then click "Fuses" on the left side of the dialog window. From here, you can either click check boxes or go directly to the hex numbers at the bottom. I prefer going directly to the hex numbers since I already know what values to use. Use these settings: <br>

Extended: 0xFF <br>
High: 0xD9 <br>
Low: 0x62 <br>

The appropriate check boxes will automagically update in the top of the window.

To send these settings to the chip, click the Program button.
*CAUTION:* Do NOT set the RSTDSBL bit. If you do, the chip will no longer accept ISP programming instructions.
