#summary February Batch.

= Introduction =
*Update 3/26* 50 boards have been kitted/built so far and I am cranking them out. This week I more than doubled my goal of 10 with 23 built...

*Update 3/18* First 10+ Built and tested boards shipped. My goal is to ship at least 10 a week until the backlog is gone...

*Update 3/12* All kits have shipped...

*Update 3/11* Boards are in and shipping has started for the kits. Built and International (Kit - Built) will follow as fast as I can finish the assembly...

*Update 3/4* The first test board passed 100% of the tests, the first 10 boards will ship this week. The remaining 90 boards should be here any day now...

*Update 3/1* The first 10 boards arrived, The first one is assembled and going through extensive testing. Test are about 80% done so far everything is perfect. Boards will start shipping this week...


*Update 2/23* 100 boards are on the way. For the first time they will be mostly built instead of blank boards, when they arrive on my end they will have all SMT parts and most through hole parts already assembled by Gold Pheonix. Kits will be more complete and just require soldering for 2 parts the Power supply and the DC/DC converter.

This is to reserve a spot (20 available) in the February batch of boards.
Boards are built by hand at an average rate of 5 boards per week. Overflow will wrap to March slots.

Inital spots assigned based on comments on the ordering page. Kits will ship first followed by assembled and tested units. Boards will ship in order, unpaid reservations will be skipped until payment is recieved.
