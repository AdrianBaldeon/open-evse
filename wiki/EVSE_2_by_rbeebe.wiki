#summary Outdoor OpenEVSE using Hammond Enclosure and OpenEVSE Plus v2 with LCD and RTC.

= Introduction =
I have another page describing [EVSE_by_rbeebe building an OpenEVSE] for my Ford C-MAX Energi. I recently leased a Smart ED (Electric Drive) and needed a place to plug it in. Since the first OpenEVSE was fun to put together and less expensive than the commercial EVSE's I decided to buy and build another one.

Since this is my second build I felt more comfortable with the process so I opted for an OpenEVSE kit. I'm glad that Chris is now selling the kit with all the ancillary parts to save hunting for them. And I ordered the same 25 foot Leviton cable and J1772 plug.

= Collect the parts =

The first step was gathering all the materials. A Leviton 30-amp charge cable is on the left. Next to it is a 10-gauge rubber cable from Home Depot that I had left over from a home generator project. Inside that coil are 2 gland nuts, 2 fuse holders, a current transformer and a 30-amp relay. Upper right is a 30-amp twist lock plug and an illuminated button from Adafruit.
