#summary May/June Batch.

= Introduction =
*Update 7/16* Tracking Estimated Delivery Fri 7/19/2013 10:30 am

*Update 7/16* Finally -  Shipped 2013-07-16 09:17:35

*Update 7/11* Approved test boards via photo, approved the whole batch for shipping. The long wait is just about over. Thanks everyone for hanging in there...

*Update 7/10* Things are finally moving, after every possible delay you could think of gold phoenix has commuted to shipping the first 10 tomorrow via fedex and the second 90 once I approve the test batch. I guess they were a bit off when they quoted 19 days (5 for PCBs production and 14 for assembly) way back on 4/30

*Update 7/1* parts delayed in customs... what else...?

*Update 6/25* Gold Phoenix will ship boards this week, they were delaying production due to a back ordered part. I have plenty so I will add the part on my end. 

Their automated system was incorrectly showing 100% complete because they exceeded their 14 day production quote by way too many days...

*Update 6/20* Boards have not arrived yet but should be in any day now... 

*Update 5/20* Boards are in production

*Update 4/30* 100 boards ordered for the next batch


This is to reserve a spot (100 available) in the May/June batch of boards.
Boards are built by hand at an average rate of 5-10 boards per week. 

Kits will ship first followed by assembled and tested units. Boards will ship in order, unpaid reservations will be skipped until payment is received.
