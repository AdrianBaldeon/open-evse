=EV Simulator Assembly and Operation=

  =!Usual Disclaimers apply. Proceed at your own risk!=

==Parts:==
  * Simulator Board
  * 1N4148 diode
  * 246立 resistor
  * 882立 resistor
  * 2.740k立 resistor				        
  * 2x5 header (male) or two 1x5 pin headers		
  * 1x2 pin male (2)

==Assembly==

1. Install the diode as marked. The line on the diode must be next to the lower hole (as marked on the circuit board). Solder.

2. Install each resistor in its labeled position on the board and solder.

3. Mount the 5x2 pin header with the short pins down, in the two rows of 4 holes under A, B, C, D, F. Solder. 
  * If you use two 5x1 headers, attach the jumpers on the ends of the rows to hold the two rows of headers in alignment. Solder the middle pins to the board. Remove the jumpers before soldering the pins they are connected to!
4. Solder a 2x1 pin header to the two Pilot holes.
5. (Optional) Solder a 2x1 pin header to the two Scope holes.
  * Alternative methods for connecting to the Pilot and Scope holes:
    # Solder wires directly to the holes.
    # Solder wires to the pins. (Put shrink wrap over the wires, solder connection then slip shrink wrap over the exposed metal and heat to shrink)

==Operation:== 
Position a jumper across the two pins below each letter to select the test states:
 * A= Not plugged into car.
 * B= Plugged into car but not charging.
 * C= Charging.
 * D= Ventilation request.
 * F= No diode. 2 jumpers: one at the F position; the second at the B position.

  =!Caution: when the EVSE is powered there can be dangerous levels of electricity present!=

Plug the  EVSE into a 120VAC circuit.

Connect the Pilot and ground to proper pins on the J1772 Plug.
 * Pilot and Scope are the pins next to the edge of the board.
 * Ground is the position next to the 246立 resistor.
