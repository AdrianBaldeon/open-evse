#summary Loading Firmware with AVRDude.


== AVRDude ==
If you want a quick and way to upload unmodified code install AVRDude and download the pre-compiled hex file in the downloads section.

Adafruit has some really good tutorials for installing and running AVRDude...

If you built your own board and your EVSE has never had any version of EVSE firmware or an Arduino boot loader (virgin chip) you will need to set your AVR fuses before loading the OpenEVSE hex file.. Setting fuses only needs to be done once.

Command assumes you are using the USBtiny, if using another programmer substitute the correct programmer after -c
{{{
avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m
avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p -U hfuse:w:0xDA:m
avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p -U efuse:w:0x05:m

*NOTE:* The extended bits (efuse) setting may get a readback of "FD" rather than "05". This is okay. "FD" is functionally the same as "05" and you can use either value to accomplish the same thing. 
}}}

Once your board has its fuses set you can load the OpenEVSE firmware.

For windows...
Create a folder on C:\ called OpenEVSE
Copy the HEX file to that folder
run cmd for the command prompt.
type "C:\OpenEVSE"
from the C:\OpenEVSE folder run the following command:

Command assumes you are using the USBtiny, if using another programmer substitute the correct programmer after -c
{{{
avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p -U flash:w:open_evse.hex
}}}

Alternate command if using serial FTDI with the Arduino bootloader. (Arduino boards or OpenEVSE with Arduio bootloader)
{{{
avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -P COMxx -b 115200 -D flash:w:open_evse.hex 
}}}
