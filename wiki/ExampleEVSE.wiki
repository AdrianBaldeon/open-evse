#summary An EVSE built with a Open EVSE board.

= Introduction =

This is an example of a 30A EVSE build with the Open EVSE GFCI board. For Open EVSE without GFCI, the Current transformer is not required. 

This should not be attempted by anyone without the required skills and knowledge to work with high voltage.

= EVSE Ground =

NOTE: The Open EVSE control Board must be grounded to the EV/Earth Ground for the pilot to operate correctly. If using an isolated power supply (PS not grounded) the OPEN EVSE board will need an additional connection to ground.
