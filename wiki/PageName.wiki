#summary Guide for Assembling a J1772, 75A OpenEVSE Plus v2.
=IN PROGRESS=
= Introduction =
 
This an open source design for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment. More information is posted at http://code.google.com/p/open-evse/

*This evaluation board/kit is intended for use for ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT, DEMONSTRATION, OR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY and is not considered to be a finished end-product fit for general consumer use.*

This project requires the use of tools and methods that can cause injury if not performed correctly. Any electrical work can be dangerous. This EVSE operates on 240Volts AC up to 75 Amps. Improper assembly can cause damage to the car, fire, injury and/or death. Do not attempt this project unless you are qualified. 

This guide is based on information gleaned from garygid, chris1howell, glennD and mwolrich. It is written by a novice to help people at a similar level. It assumes that one has the basic skills for soldering, wire work, working with electricity and general understanding of how to assemble things. Think about each step critically before proceeding. If any step seems questionable or you are uncomfortable with it, don’t do it. Get advice from a knowledgeable person if something is not clear or seems questionable.

*No warranty, guarantee or assurances are made that this will work, be safe or last. In other words, proceed at your own risk!*

= Notes: =

Current Transformer- Component listed is too small. Needed to squeeze the 6AWG wires into oblong shape to fit them through but it is very tight fit. A 11/16” hole diameter or larger is required. 

My project used a smaller box than listed on the “Parts List” link. This necessitated cutting a hole in the metal partition to close over the Contactor. 

A larger strain relief collar for the J1772 cable may better. It is a tight fit but doable.


Changes for assembling the OpenEVSE Plus Version 2- 
1.	Version 2 has three connections for the Relay Coil. This project has one DPST relay using the Relay 1, 12VDC and the Relay Common connections.
2.	The Relay 2, 12VDC connection is used if your design has two SPST relays. The second relay connects to the Relay Common as well. Using 2 relays allows the self tests to run one leg at a time avoiding powering the J1772 handle during the test. Also, power can be removed from a leg if there is a stuck relay.
3.	There is a row of three 0.1” pins next to the Relay connections. The two pins closest to the edge of the board are for the CT Coil. They are not polarized.
